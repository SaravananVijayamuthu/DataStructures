This repo contains a series of DS problems solved in JAVA.

## Problems

```
   ◾ Middle element of linked list
   ◾ Detect Loop/Cyclic in linked list
   ◾ Get 3rd (Kth) node end/ tail of linked list
```

## Logic
❌ __Middle element of linked list__
```
     - Initialize Two pointers and head node should not be null
     - One pointer should traverse the LL 1 by 1 and another pointer by 2
     - When one pointer reaches the tail another reaches the mid of node

```
❌ __Detect Loop/Cyclic in linked list__
```
     - Initialize Two pointers and head node should not be null
     - One pointer should traverse the LL 1 by 1 and another pointer by 2
     - if two pointers are == then ll contains Loop

```
❌ __Get (3rd)Kth Node from last/tail of linked list__
```
     - Initialize Two pointers and head node should not be null
     - One poniter should traverse the ll by 1 till end. count will also increase
     - When n is equal to count the loop breaks and the other pointer reaches the nth value in node

```
